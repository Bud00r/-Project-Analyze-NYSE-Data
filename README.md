 # Project-Analyze-NYSE-Data


Planning ahead
These files listed here are what you will be working on in the project:
1-The presentation with the visuals and summary
2- A copy of the spreadsheet workbook you will use to do the analysis for your report contains the following tabs:
     A- Data file
     B- Summary statistics
     c- P&L Statement Dashboard
     D- Forecast scenarios
     
Task 1:
        a. Identify the question about the data that you will answer based on your data analysis and include this in your slide presentation.
        b. Your slide presentation should provide at least one visualization to help support your answer.
        
Task 2:
       A- Create a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list.              Include all companies from the raw data.
       B- Your drop-down list should pull historical fundamentals data to create the P&L Statement.
       c- The P&L statement should include the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT values for all the years there is historical data available for that company in              the dataset.
       D- Deliverable: Spreadsheet with tab for Dynamic P&L statement
       
Task 3:
       A- Create a financial model for a company (different from Task 2) of your choice that forecasts out the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for two more years        using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case, and Base case).
       B- Your assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin, and operating margin should change for each scenario.
       c-  The forecasting model should be dynamic for the selection of the case (Weak, Base, Strong). However, the forecasting model can be static for the chosen               company sticker symbol.
       D- Deliverable: Spreadsheet with tab for Forecasting Model
